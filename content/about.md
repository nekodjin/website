Hi there! I'm Avery, and my pronouns are **she/her**. I'm a 16 year old student
from the East Coast.

I'm an amateur programmer with experience in [Rust][rs] and [C#][cs]. I enjoy
creating CLI apps - mostly because I have no experience with GUI or TUI. I also
enjoy writing low-level apps, such as emulators and compilers.

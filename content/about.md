Hi there! I'm **Avery**, and my pronouns are **she/her**. I'm a
Portuguese-American student from the East Coast of the United States. You can
find me on the following platforms:
-   Discord, as **nekodjin**
-   Fediverse, as **@nekodjin@snug.moe**
-   GitHub, as [nekodjin][gh]
-   The WCA, as [2024ROSE06][wca]

I'm an amateur programmer with experience in [Rust][rs]. I enjoy writing CLI/TUI
apps as well as low-level tools like emulators and compilers. I also have
experience with **C**, [Haskell][hs], [Python][py], [C#][cs], [F#][fs], assorted
**Assembly Languages**, and [HTML][html] / [CSS][css] / [JavaScript][js], to varying
degrees of proficiency.

I love learning languages, and am a native speaker of both **English** and
**European Portuguese**. I have studied **Latin** for 4 years, **Japanese**
for 5 years, and **Ancient Greek** for 1 year.

Hi there! I'm **Avery**, and my pronouns are **she/her**. I'm a
Portuguese-American student from the East Coast of the United States. You can
find me on [GitHub][gh], and on Discord as **nekodjin#0001**.

I'm an amateur programmer with experience in [Rust][rs] and [C#][cs]. I enjoy
creating CLI apps - mostly because I have no experience with GUI or TUI. I also
enjoy writing low-level apps, such as emulators and compilers.

I love learning languages, and speak both **English** and (European)
**Portuguese** as first languages. I have studied **Latin** for 4 years, and
have been studying **Japanese** for 4 years and counting.

I also enjoy mathematics and science, especially where the two intersect and
where I can model that intersection on a computer. I'm particularly interested
in chemistry.

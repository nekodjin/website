Hi there! I'm **Avery**, and my pronouns are **she/her**. I'm a
Portuguese-American student from the East Coast of the United States. You can
find me on my [GitHub][gh], and on Discord as **nekodjin#0001**.

I'm an amateur programmer with experience in [Rust][rs] and [C#][cs]. I enjoy
writing CLI apps - mostly because I have no experience with GUI or TUI - as well
as low-level apps, such as emulators and compilers. I also have experience with
**C**, [Haskell][hs], [Python][py], [F#][fs], assorted **Assembly Languages**,
and [HTML][html]/[CSS][css]/JavaScript[js], to varying degrees of proficiency.

I love learning languages, and speak both **English** and **European
Portuguese** as first languages. I have studied **Latin** for 4 years, and have
been studying **Japanese** for 4 (years and counting). I'm a member of the
[Viossa][vp] community, and am currently learning [Toki Pona][tp].

I enjoy **mathematics** and **science**, especially where the two intersect, and
where I can model that intersection on a computer. I'm particularly interested
in **chemistry**. I'm currently working on some **stoichiometry** utilities,
which will be available on this website when completed.

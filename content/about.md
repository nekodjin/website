Hi there! I'm **Avery**, and my pronouns are **she/her**. I'm a
Portuguese-American student from the East Coast of the United States. You can
find me on the following platforms:
-   Discord, as **nekodjin#1813**
-   Fediverse, as **@nekodjin@snug.moe**
-   GitHub, as [nekodjin][gh]
-   Twitter, as [@nekodjin][tw]

I'm an amateur programmer with experience predominantly in [Rust][rs]. I enjoy
writing CLI/TUI apps as well as low-level apps such as emulators and compilers.
I also have experience with **C**, [Haskell][hs], [Python][py], [C#][cs],
[F#][fs], assorted **Assembly Languages**, and [HTML][html] / [CSS][css] /
[JavaScript][js], to varying degrees of proficiency.

I love learning languages, and speak both **English** and **European
Portuguese** as first languages. I have studied **Latin** for 4 years, and have
been studying **Japanese** for 4 years (and counting). I'm a member of the
[Viossa][vp] community, and am currently learning [Toki Pona][tp].

I enjoy **mathematics** and **science**, especially where the two intersect, and
where I can model that intersection on a computer. I'm especially interested
in **chemistry**.

My current obsession is **language development** - the art of designing a
programming language, as well as implementing a compiler or an interpreter for
it.
